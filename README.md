# Project3GroceryList
1) Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:
  Code that reads grocery items from a txt document and tels user either how many of a select item there are or prints different types of lists to show quantities of all items

2)What did you do particularly well?
  I felt that I was able to read data from one document and ouput to another document fairly easily and I feel my implementation was exetremely efficient.

3)Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  One area I was told would have been nice was if I had seperated my files so that my main code was represented on one file and my functions represented on another. I do agree that it would make my code more easy to read and would allow others to more easily take my functions and use them for other projects.

4)Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I found that geting my code to work within the visual studio was the most challangeing aspect and I also found that getting the code to output correctly took a lot of time and effort, I       kept getting inifite looped responses and it would continue to not want to recognize certain words, Peas just for example. I think I will use the gitHub resource more often in the future.

5)What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? 
  Like I said before I found that reading from one file and outputting to another was my favorite part and something I feel will be most useful to me moving forward and transfering to other projects.
  
6)How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  Going through one part at a time and moking sure moy comments accuratley reflected what I was doing was the most important part for me being able to maintain where I was.
